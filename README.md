# Flight delay and cancellation analysis

## Executive Summary
Using SQL and Power BI, I analyzed flight performance data to identify delay patterns across airlines, routes, and time periods. After cleaning the dataset and building an interactive dashboard, I found that the major factors contributing to delays include operational congestion, peak-hour scheduling, and certain high-traffic routes. Based on the analysis, I recommend a few actions that could help improve overall on-time performance:

1. Optimize flight schedules during peak traffic hours
2. Improve aircraft turnaround processes for busy routes

## Bussiness Problem
Airline operations are heavily influenced by flight punctuality, as delays and cancellations can lead to increased costs, and dissatisfied passengers. Understanding patterns in flight delays and cancellations is critical for improving customer experience and minimizing operational losses. The primary challenge is to identify which flights, routes, or airlines are most prone to delays or cancellations and quantify the impact on overall performance.
